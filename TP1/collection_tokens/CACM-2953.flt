on
recursion
elimination
various
methods
of
recursion
elimination
are
applied
to
the
schematic
recursive
procedure
proc
s

procedures
with
this
general
form
arise
in
connection
with
tree
traversal
and
sorting
algorithms
each
method
of
recursion
removal
involves
the
use
of
one
or
more
stacks
and
the
solutions
are
compared
on
the
basis
of
their
running
