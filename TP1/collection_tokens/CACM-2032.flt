file
structures
using
hashing
functions
a
general
method
of
file
structuring
is
proposed
which
uses
a
hashing
function
to
define
tree
structure
two
types
of
such
trees
are
examined
and
their
relation
to
trees
studied
in
the
past
is
explained
results
for
the
probability
distributions
of
path
lengths
are
derived
and
illustrated
