a
modification
of
warshall
s
algorithm
for
the
transitive
closure
of
binary
relations
an
algorithm
is
given
for
computing
the
transitive
closure
of
a
binary
relation
that
is
represented
by
a
boolean
matrix
the
algorithm
is
similar
to
warshall
s
although
it
executes
faster
for
sparse
matrices
on
most
computers
particularly
in
a
paging
environment
