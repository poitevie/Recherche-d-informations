a
nonrecursive
list
moving
algorithm
an
efficient
nonrecursive
algorithm
is
given
for
moving
any
lisp
type
list
in
particular
the
algorithm
requires
no
storage
other
than
the
new
nodes
into
which
the
list
is
to
be
moved
and
no
additional
bits
per
node
for
marking
the
algorithm
runs
in
time
proportional
to
the
number
of
nodes
in
the
list
the
original
list
structure
is
destroyed
as
it
is
moved
