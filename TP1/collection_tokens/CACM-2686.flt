an
approximate
method
for
generating
asymmetric
random
variables
tukey
s
lambda
distribution
is
generalized
to
provide
an
algorithm
for
generating
values
of
unimodal
asymmetric
random
variables
this
algorithm
has
the
same
advantages
as
the
symmetric
random
variable
generator
previously
given
by
the
authors
except
that
the
addition
of
another
parameter
complicates
the
problem
of
finding
the
parameter
values
to
fit
a
distribution
