approximate
solution
of

equation
problems
by
boundary
value
techniques
a
new
boundary
value
technique
is
proposed
for
the
treatment
of
initial
boundary
value
problems
for
linear
and
mildly
nonlinear
wave
equations
several
illustrative
examples
are
offered
to
demonstrate
the
ease
with
which
the
method
can
be
applied
