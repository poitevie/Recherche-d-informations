some
techniques
for
using
pseudorandom
numbers
in
computer
simulation
an
algorithm
is
described
by
which
uniform
pseudorandom
integers
may
be
used
to
construct
binary
numbers
in
which
the
probability
that
each
bit
in
the
word
is
a
bit
and
can
assume
any
desired
parameter
value
techniques
for
making
use
of
such
numbers
in
simulation
programming
are
described
