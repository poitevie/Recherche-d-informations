a
theory
of
discrete
patterns
and
their
implementation
in
snobol
the
notion
of
a
discrete
pattern
is
formalized
and
certain
properties
deduced
a
pattern
is
shown
to
be
a
generalization
of
a
formal
language
algorithms
for
implementing
the
kinds
of
patterns
in
snobol
are
given
the
general
approach
is
to
create
in
so
far
as
possible
a
bottom
up
parse
from
a
top
down
specification
