an
optimal
real
time
algorithm
for
planar
convex
hulls
an
algorithm
is
described
for
the
construction
in
real
time
of
the
convex
hull
of
a
set
of
n
points
in
the
plane
using
an
appropriate
data
structure
the
algorithm
constructs
the
convex
hull
by
successive
updates
each
taking
time
o
log
n
thereby
achieving
a
total
processing
time
o
n
log
