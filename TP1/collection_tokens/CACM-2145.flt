etching
pattern
layout
program
is
an
application
program
developed
to
computerize
the
tedious
and
error
prone
although
vitally
important
wiring
design
of
printed
circuit
boards
help
helps
automate
a
design
stage
one
step
closer
to
production
than
logical
design
it
can
be
used
to
design
wiring
patterns
of
two
layer
circuit
boards
on
which
ics
in
dual
in
line
packages
as
well
as
discrete
components
such
as
transistors
and
resistors
have
been
placed
help
employs
two
methods
of
wiring
one
is
the
heuristic
method
which
simulates
human
approaches
to
wiring
design
and
the
other
is
the
theoretically
interesting
but
time
consuming
method
of
maze
running
based
on
the
lee
s
algorithm
help
performs
more
than
percent
of
required
wiring
by
the
heuristic
path
with
respect
to
a
performance
function
for
each
point
to
point
and
point
to
line
connection
it
can
bring
the
number
of
successful
wiring
connections
very
close
to
percent
