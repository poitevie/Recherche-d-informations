datan
a
process
for
fitting
a

to
approximate
data
and
the
problem
it
creates
for

engineer
programmer
is
defined
an
approach
has
also
been
defined
and
a
system
has
been
written
for
the

to
mechanize
a
major

of
this
process
the
techniques
developed
to
accomplish
the
mechanization
are
largely
empirical
and
