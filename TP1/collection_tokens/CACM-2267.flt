algorithms
to
reveal
properties
of
floating
point
arithmetic
two
algorithms
are
presented
in
the
form
of
fortran
subroutines
each
subroutine
computes
the
radix
and
number
of
digits
of
the
floating
point
numbers
and
whether
rounding
or
chopping
is
done
by
the
machine
on
which
it
is
run
the
methods
are
shown
to
work
on
any
reasonable
floating
point
computer
