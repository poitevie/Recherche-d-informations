on
computing
radiation
integrals
the
relative
merit
and
cost
of
four
ways
of
evaluating
typical
radiation
integrals
containing
spherical
bessel
functions
are
investigated
these
methods
are
desk
machine
evaluation
of
a
finite
series
integration
of
the
appropriate
differential
equation
by
a
reeves
electronic
analog
computer
and
by
a
litton
ibm
computer
results
are
generally
applicable
to
equations
separated
from
a
helmholtz
or
wave
equation
