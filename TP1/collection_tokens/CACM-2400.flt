use
of
the
hough
transformation
todetect
lines
and
curves
in
pictures
hough
has
proposed
an
interesting
and
computationally
efficient
procedure
for
detecting
lines
in
pictures
this
paper
points
out
that
the
use
of
angle
radius
rather
than
slope
intercept
parameters
simplifies
the
computation
further
it
also
shows
how
the
method
can
be
used
for
more
general
curve
fitting
and
gives
alternative
interpretations
that
explain
the
source
of
its
efficiency
