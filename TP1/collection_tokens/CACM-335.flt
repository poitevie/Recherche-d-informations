some

for
nonlinear

value
problems
using
a
generalization
of
newton
s
method
a
nonlinear
parabolic
equation
of
the
form
u

g

and
a
nonlinear

equation
u

exp
u
are
solved
numerically
comparison
of
these
results
with
results
obtained
using
the
picard
iteration
procedure
show
that
in
many
cases
the
quisi
linearization
method
offers
substantial
advantages
in
both
time
and
accuracy
