poisson
series
of
three
variables
are
manageable
symbolically
through
as
a
set
of
formal
subroutines
written
partially
in
the
ibm
machine
language
but
to
be
called
in
the
fortran
language
for
use
in
fortran
programs
an
effort
has
been
made
to
supply
those
operations
which
are
most
required
by
celestial
mechanics
the
routines
are
entirely
self
contained
subroutines
and
require
only
standard
fortran
input
output
units
and
they
are
design
to
avoid
waste
and
overflow
of
core
storage
