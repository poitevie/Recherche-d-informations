how
to
share
a
secret
in
this
paper
we
show
how
to
divide
data
d
into
n
pieces
in
such
a
way
that
d
is
easily
reconstructable
from
any
k
pieces
but
even
complete
knowledge
of
k
pieces
reveals
olutely
no
information
about
d
this
technique
enables
the
construction
of
robust
key
management
schemes
for
cryptographic
systems
that
can
function
securely
and
reliably
even
when
misfortunes
destroy
half
the
pieces
and
security
breaches
expose
all
but
one
of
the
remaining
pieces
