automatic
integration
of
a
function
with
a
parameter
two
efficient
methods
for
automatic
numerical
integration
are
romberg
integration
and
adaptive
simpson
integration
for
integrands
of
the
form
f
x
g
x
a
where
a
is
a
parameter
it
is
shown
that
romberg
s
method
is
more
efficient
a
fortran
program
shows
how
to
achieve
this
greater
efficiency
