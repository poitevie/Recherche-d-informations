sorting
on
a
mesh
connected
parallel
computer
two
algorithms
are
presented
for
sorting
n
elements
on
an
n
x
n
mesh
connected
processor
array
that
require
o
n
routing
and
comparison
steps
the
best
previous
algorithm
takes
time
o
n
log
n
the
algorithms
of
this
paper
are
shown
to
be
optimal
in
time
within
small
constant
factors
extensions
to
higher
dimensional
arrays
are
