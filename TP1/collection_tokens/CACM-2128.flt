a
processor
allocation
method
for
time
sharing
a
scheduling
algorithm
is
proposed
which
is
intended
to
minimize
changes
of
tasks
on
processors
and
thereby
reduce
over
head
the
algorithm
also
has
application
to
more
general
resource
allocation
problems
it
is
implemented
by
means
of
a
method
for
efficiently
handling
dynamically
changing
segmented
lists
