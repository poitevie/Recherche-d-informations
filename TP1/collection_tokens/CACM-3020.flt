systematic
recursion
removal
the
recursion
removal
algorithm
presented
by
strong
and
walker
is
amplified
and
applied
to
a
relatively
complex
pl
i
program
the
aim
is
to
demonstrate
systematic
recursion
removal
techniques
on
something
more
complex
than
knuth
s
sturdy
toddler
and
to
obtain
measurements
of
the
cost
of
procedure
linkage
in
pl
i
and
the
savings
achievable
via
procedure
integration
in
the
presence
of
recursion
first
the
paper
describes
the
recursion
removal
process
and
the
example
on
which
it
will
be
illustrated
recursion
removal
is
then
applied
to
the
two
major
parts
of
this
example
and
the
final
result
of
the
process
is
displayed
our
performance
comparison
results
are
presented
and
our
conclusions
are
briefly
discussed
